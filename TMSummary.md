##Learn from others 

##Practice 
We first develop some rules for us to follow. 
Rule 1, make the habbit of ranging your next day before you go to bed. Let's say we have to do Item1, Item2, Item3 for next day. 
Rule 2, Write down you expected time spending on each item. And at the same time write down how much time is actually spent on this item. 
Rule 3, When you spend you time slot for a specific item, think before you move.   
Say our item is: calling a friend.   
Have this in mind: 
1) How long do you want to be in the call?   
2) What is the purpose for the call?  
3) Other activities following up this call?
